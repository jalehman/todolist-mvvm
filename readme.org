* MVC: Model-View-Controller

[[./img/mvc.png]]

+ Architectural design pattern
+ Developed by Xerox PARC in the 1970s
+ Expressed as a general concept in 1988

** It's an old concept

+ Which is not bad
+ Good ideas are improved upon over time

* MVVM: Model-View-ViewModel

[[./img/mvvm.png]]

+ Developed by Microsoft, announced in 2005
+ A slight addition to MVC
+ We'll discuss *Data Binding* later

** Adds the /ViewModel/ 

#+begin_quote
"The central component of MVC, the model, captures the behavior of the
application in terms of its problem domain, independent of the user interface."

-- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller#Components][Wikipedia]]
#+end_quote

/(where *user interface* is the View and Controller)/

#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_quote
The =ViewModel= captures the behaviors of an user interface in terms of general
user interactions, independent of the view itself.
#+end_quote

** Why is this a good thing?

[[./img/massive-view-controller.png]]

+ Smaller view controllers!
+ Lower coupling
  + Decouples GUI code from presentation logic and state
+ Headless testing
 

* In Practice: MVVM in Cocoa

[[./img/swift.png]]

** Views

+ Comprised of =UIViewController=, =UIView=, nibs, storyboards

** View and ViewModel Relationship

+ /Generally/, one =ViewModel= per controller or =UIView= subclass:
  + =UIViewController=
  + =UITableViewCell=
  + =UICollectionViewCell=
  + etc.

** Ownership

[[./img/mvvm.png]]

+ The *View* /owns/ the *ViewModel*
  + ViewModels know /nothing/ about Views
+ The *ViewModel* /owns/ the *Model*
  + Models know /nothing/ about ViewModels
+ The *View* knows /nothing/ about the *Model*

** Views do not communicate!

Views communicate with their ViewModels, which communicate with each other.
** Problem

If the view's state is stored in a =ViewModel= class, how do we keep the two in
sync?

** Data Binding

+ Not strictly /necessary/, but really helpful
  + Delegates can work here, but are more verbose
+ Helps keep =ViewModel= in sync with its =View=

*** 1-way > 2-way

+ 2-way binding is really hard (it's cyclical)
  + If 2-way binding seems like the only solution, find a better solution

*** [[https://github.com/SwiftBond/Bond][ReactiveCocoa]] (RAC)

+ Mostly based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming][Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)]]
  + Represent data as "streams of values over time"
+ Used at: [[http://savvy.ai][Savvy]], Snapchat, GitHub, probably some other places too

*** Popular and well-maintained

+ First released :: 2/26/2012
+ Last commit to master :: 11/3/2015 (at time of writing)
+ Stars :: 11,081
+ Contributors :: 129

*** [[https://github.com/SwiftBond/Bond][Bond]]

+ A data binding framework
+ Less concept-heavy 
+ Also well maintained
+ I am less familiar with it -- examples will use RAC


* Interlude: ReactiveCocoa

** What is "Functional Reactive Programming"?

#+begin_quote 
Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm for reactive
programming (asynchronous dataflow programming) using the building blocks of
functional programming (e.g. map, reduce, filter).
#+end_quote

** Signals

+ Represent streams of values (data) as they change
+ Signals can be /observed/
+ Two varieties in RAC: =SignalProducer= and =Signal=
+ Send /events/:
  + =next=: The data that the signal carries -- can happen many times
  + =error=: An error occurred -- terminates
  + =interrupted=: The signal was interrupted -- terminates
  + =completed=: Successful completion -- terminates

** Signal Producers

#+begin_src swift
func doNetworkStuff() -> SignalProducer<JSON, NoError>
let producer = doNetworkStuff()
producer.startWithNext { json in print(json) }
#+end_src

+ Has to be "started" to do anything
+ Kind of like promises
+ Network requests are a good example

** Signals

+ Send values regardless of whether or not anything is observing
+ "Always On" semantics

** Mutable Properties

#+begin_src swift
let text = MutableProperty<String>("Hello, World!")
text.value // => "Hello, World!"
text.producer // => SignalProducer<String, NoError>
text.producer.startWithNext { s in print(s) } // prints "Hello, World!"
text.value = "Yo." // prints "Yo"
#+end_src

+ Exposes a =SignalProducer= of the values in the property

** Binding

#+begin_src swift
let (observer, producer) = SignalProducer<String, NoError>.buffer()
let text = MutableProperty<String>("")
text <~ producer
observer.sendNext("a")
text.value // "a"
observer.sendNext("b")
text.value // "b"
#+end_src

+ We can /bind/ the result of a =SignalProducer= to a =MutableProperty=
+ The binding operator: =<~=
+ No =KVO=!
  

** Actions

#+begin_src swift
func saveTodoOnServer(todo: Todo) -> SignalProducer<Bool, NSError> { 
    return SignalProducer(value: true)
}
let createTodo = Action { (t: Todo) -> SignalProducer<Bool, NSError> in 
    return saveTodoOnServer(t) 
}
let todo = Todo()
createTodo.values.observeNext { success in print(success) }
createTodo.apply(todo) // => SignalProducer<Bool, NSError>
createTodo.apply(todo).start() // prints "true"
createTodo.apply(todo).start() // prints "true"
#+end_src

+ Like a function, but where the result of invocation is /observed/ rather than
  /returned/
  + Can have many observers!
+ Take parameters, return a =SignalProducer=
  + We /apply/ parameters, and then /start/ the resulting producer
  + Expose =values= property: A =Signal= of the values of the =SignalProducer=

* A Sample Application: Todo List

** ViewModels Drive the Application

#+begin_src swift
protocol ViewModelServicesProtocol {
    
    var todo: TodoServiceProtocol { get }
    var date: DateServiceProtocol { get }
    
    func push(viewModel: ViewModelProtocol)
    func pop(viewModel: ViewModelProtocol)
}

protocol ViewModelProtocol {
    var services: ViewModelServicesProtocol { get }
}
#+end_src

*** Navigation

#+begin_src swift
func push(viewModel: ViewModelProtocol)
func pop(viewModel: ViewModelProtocol)
#+end_src

+ *ViewModels* will instantiate and =push= other *ViewModels*.
+ Services are responsible for instantiating the proper Views.

*** Model Services

#+begin_src swift
protocol TodoServiceProtocol {    
    func update(todo: Todo) -> SignalProducer<Todo, NoError>
    func delete(todo: Todo) -> SignalProducer<Bool, NoError>
    func create(note: String, dueDate: NSDate) -> SignalProducer<Todo, NoError>
}
#+end_src

+ Model services deal with stateful resources, e.g. network operations
+ Only *ViewModels* have access to services

** Views Observe ViewModels and /React/

#+begin_src swift
class TodoTableViewModel: ViewModel, CreateTodoViewModelDelegate {
    let todos = MutableProperty<[TodoCellViewModel]>([])
    let deleteTodo: Action<(todos: [TodoCellViewModel], cell: TodoCellViewModel), NSIndexPath?, NoError>
}
class TodoTableViewController: ReactiveViewController<TodoTableViewModel> {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        func removeRow(indexPath: NSIndexPath?) {
            todoTableView.deleteRowsAtIndexPaths([indexPath!], withRowAnimation: .Left)
        }
        // Remove a row whenever a Todo is deleted
        viewModel.deleteTodo.values
            .filter { $0 != nil }
            .observeOn(UIScheduler())
            .observeNext(removeRow)
    }
}
#+end_src
